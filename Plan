Plan:


Front end:

- have a html page for the user login(password and username)
- another page asking for 2fa code


- then another page displaying the code(different url i guess to simulate the "app")
- then say if it has been successfull or not(try again for both password and 2fa code)

- if successfull, display page of successfull outcome



Back end:

- connect to database to store and register a user
- not needed for 2fa as that will be on front end

- additional: hash the password


2fa:

- generate random 4 digit number every 30 seconds
- display some color design/ icon idk
